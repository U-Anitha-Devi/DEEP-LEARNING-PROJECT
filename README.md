INTERN ID : CT06DH1407

DOMAIN : DATA SCIENCE 

DURATION : 6 WEEKS

MENTOR : Neela Santhosh Kumar

DESCRIPTION :

Deep Learning Project Using TensorFlow (CNN & RNN):
This is a deep learning project built using TensorFlow/Keras, demonstrating two powerful neural network architectures:
1.Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification
2.Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for time-series forecasting

** Convolutional Neural Network:- 
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a specialized deep learning architecture designed for processing data with a grid-like structure, such as images. CNNs automatically learn and extract spatial features from input data by using convolutional filters, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.In this project, the CNN was implemented using TensorFlow/Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

What I Did Using CNN:
-->Data preparation and normalization
-->Built a CNN architecture with convolutional, pooling, dense, and dropout layers
-->Trained the model and evaluated performance
-->Visualized training/validation accuracy and loss



** Recurrent Neural Network:-
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a Sequence Classification, An RNN is a deep learning model designed for sequential data, capturing temporal dependencies by maintaining memory of previous inputs. It’s ideal for tasks like time series, text, and speech processing.

What I Did Using RNN:
-->Prepared sequential data with scaling and encoding
-->Designed an RNN architecture to learn temporal patterns
-->Trained and evaluated the model
-->Visualized performance metrics


Tools Used:-
Python – Programming language for building the models
TensorFlow/Keras – Deep learning framework for CNN and RNN
NumPy – For numerical operations and data generation
scikit-learn – For scaling and preprocessing time-series data
Matplotlib – For plotting results and training curves
PyCharm / Any IDE – For writing and executing the code

Real-World Applications:-
CNN:
Handwriting recognition (digit classification)
Medical imaging (disease detection)
Face recognition and biometrics
Traffic sign detection in autonomous vehicles

RNN:
Stock market prediction
Weather forecasting
Speech-to-text systems
Energy demand forecasting

Where This Can Be Applied:-
Computer Vision Projects – Object detection, face recognition, defect detection in manufacturing.
Time-Series Analysis – Predictive maintenance, financial forecasting, sales prediction.
AI Research – Experimenting with different architectures (CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU).
Automation Systems – Integrating deep learning models into real-time decision-making applications.

Final Notes:-
This Deep Learning project demonstrates two of the most important neural network architectures:
CNN for spatial data (images)
RNN for temporal data (sequences)
By working with both models, This project offers hands-on experience with CNNs and RNNs, two fundamental architectures for spatial and temporal data. It provides a foundation for exploring more advanced deep learning models and real-world AI applications.
